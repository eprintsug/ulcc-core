                <p>As <epc:phrase ref="archive_name" /> is an open access research repository, the principal content made available to users are research outputs such as articles, papers, posters and reports, many of which are PDF documents. Many PDF documents, especially older ones, are not fully accessible to screen reader software and do not contain other common accessibility features. In particular:</p>
                
                <ul>
                        <li>many documents, especially older ones, do not conform to the PDF/A archiving format.</li>
                        <li>many lack bookmarks or document titles, therefore failing to meet WCAG 2.1 success criteria 2.4.5 and 2.4.2.</li>
                        <li>many discuss scientific or scholarly concepts which may be abbreviated with no mechanism for discovering the meaning of the abbreviations, or unusual words arising from scholarly discourse without definitions. These issues each fail WCAG 2.1 criteria 3.1.4 and 3.1.1 respectively.</li>
                        <li>there may be some documents that fail to specify their human language, thereby failing WCAG 2.1 success criterion 3.1.1.</li>
                        <li>many documents may not reflow satisfactorily. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.4.10.</li>
                </ul>
